## 0.4.9 (2024-10-22)

<csr-id-64ff0a77062d35add1a2dd422bb61075647d1a36/>

### Other

 - <csr-id-64ff0a77062d35add1a2dd422bb61075647d1a36/> Update gitoxide repository URLs
   This updates `Byron/gitoxide` URLs to `GitoxideLabs/gitoxide` in:
   
   - Markdown documentation, except changelogs and other such files
     where such changes should not be made.
   
   - Documentation comments (in .rs files).
   
   - Manifest (.toml) files, for the value of the `repository` key.
   
   - The comments appearing at the top of a sample hook that contains
     a repository URL as an example.
   
   When making these changes, I also allowed my editor to remove
   trailing whitespace in any lines in files already being edited
   (since, in this case, there was no disadvantage to allowing this).
   
   The gitoxide repository URL changed when the repository was moved
   into the recently created GitHub organization `GitoxideLabs`, as
   detailed in #1406. Please note that, although I believe updating
   the URLs to their new canonical values is useful, this is not
   needed to fix any broken links, since `Byron/gitoxide` URLs
   redirect (and hopefully will always redirect) to the coresponding
   `GitoxideLabs/gitoxide` URLs.
   
   While this change should not break any URLs, some affected URLs
   were already broken. This updates them, but they are still broken.
   They will be fixed in a subsequent commit.
   
   This also does not update `Byron/gitoxide` URLs in test fixtures
   or test cases, nor in the `Makefile`. (It may make sense to change
   some of those too, but it is not really a documentation change.)

## 0.4.7 (2023-12-30)

<csr-id-3bd09ef120945a9669321ea856db4079a5dab930/>

### Chore

- <csr-id-3bd09ef120945a9669321ea856db4079a5dab930/> change `rust-version` manifest field back to 1.65.
  They didn't actually need to be higher to work, and changing them
  unecessarily can break downstream CI.

  Let's keep this value as low as possible, and only increase it when
  more recent features are actually used.

## 0.4.2 (2023-06-06)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-e14dc7d475373d2c266e84ff8f1826c68a34ab92/> note that crates have been renamed from `git-*` to `gix-*`.
   This also means that the `git-*` prefixed crates of the `gitoxide` project
   are effectively unmaintained.
   Use the crates with the `gix-*` prefix instead.
   
   If you were using `git-repository`, then `gix` is its substitute.

## 0.4.1 (2023-02-17)

<csr-id-f7f136dbe4f86e7dee1d54835c420ec07c96cd78/>

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-3d8fa8fef9800b1576beab8a5bc39b821157a5ed/> upgrade edition to 2021 in most crates.
   MSRV for this is 1.56, and we are now at 1.60 so should be compatible.
   This isn't more than a patch release as it should break nobody
   who is adhering to the MSRV, but let's be careful and mark it
   breaking.
   
   Note that `git-features` and `git-pack` are still on edition 2018
   as they make use of a workaround to support (safe) mutable access
   to non-overlapping entries in a slice which doesn't work anymore
   in edition 2021.
 - <csr-id-9d9f2ee55202788910cd955cdcc08196d18f2cf5/> Use `[u8;4]` as chunk id
   This allows to remove the additional string to describe the ids, which
   are usually ascii anyway.

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-11b0f4afc993fe1eb1316839baaa15187483d420/> `file::Index::chunks` is not public anymore
   The internal state is validated, and to assure that it can't be publicly
   accessible.
 - <csr-id-9328015c653cae582882c346965b51d7cf6b9d08/> rename `into_usize_range()` to `range::into_usize()`
 - <csr-id-dda26a4ddd7cc195c10b79a7f428d6298285197b/> rename `Kind` to `Id`
   This is more in line with gits terminology and feels quite natural to
   use as well.

### New Features

 - <csr-id-389fea2addc94801e73a521b2ac9a8529e4fbb3d/> Facilities to write chunk files
   This includes utilities to plan chunks for writing the table of
   contents, and to get a hand when actually writing the chunks themselves
   while assuring they are written into the correct spot.
 - <csr-id-373a85003e0b293666283ef742762b13e1211fc5/> add `file::Index::size_for_entries()` const fn
   This is useful for min-size checks of files that are to be loaded.
 - <csr-id-e14096e0c19689a1e2480b484537b2a0ffbfc3b9/> add `file::Index::usize_offset_by_id()` and `range::into_usize_or_panic()`
 - <csr-id-d0fab1e7f083088f607365ceec056e6e521cbdcc/> new file::Index::highest_offset() method
   With it it's simpler to figure out from where to read trailing
   checksums.

### Chore

- <csr-id-f7f136dbe4f86e7dee1d54835c420ec07c96cd78/> uniformize deny attributes

### Documentation

 - <csr-id-39ed9eda62b7718d5109135e5ad406fb1fe2978c/> fix typos

## 0.4.0 (2022-11-21)

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-3d8fa8fef9800b1576beab8a5bc39b821157a5ed/> upgrade edition to 2021 in most crates.
   MSRV for this is 1.56, and we are now at 1.60 so should be compatible.
   This isn't more than a patch release as it should break nobody
   who is adhering to the MSRV, but let's be careful and mark it
   breaking.
   
   Note that `gix-features` and `gix-pack` are still on edition 2018
   as they make use of a workaround to support (safe) mutable access
   to non-overlapping entries in a slice which doesn't work anymore
   in edition 2021.

## 0.3.2 (2022-09-20)

Maintenance release without observable changes.

## 0.3.1 (2022-08-24)

<csr-id-f7f136dbe4f86e7dee1d54835c420ec07c96cd78/>

### Chore

- <csr-id-f7f136dbe4f86e7dee1d54835c420ec07c96cd78/> uniformize deny attributes

## 0.3.0 (2022-01-23)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-389fea2addc94801e73a521b2ac9a8529e4fbb3d/> Facilities to write chunk files
   This includes utilities to plan chunks for writing the table of
   contents, and to get a hand when actually writing the chunks themselves
   while assuring they are written into the correct spot.
 - <csr-id-373a85003e0b293666283ef742762b13e1211fc5/> add `file::Index::size_for_entries()` const fn
   This is useful for min-size checks of files that are to be loaded.
 - <csr-id-e14096e0c19689a1e2480b484537b2a0ffbfc3b9/> add `file::Index::usize_offset_by_id()` and `range::into_usize_or_panic()`

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-11b0f4afc993fe1eb1316839baaa15187483d420/> `file::Index::chunks` is not public anymore
   The internal state is validated, and to assure that it can't be publicly
   accessible.
 - <csr-id-9328015c653cae582882c346965b51d7cf6b9d08/> rename `into_usize_range()` to `range::into_usize()`
 - <csr-id-dda26a4ddd7cc195c10b79a7f428d6298285197b/> rename `Kind` to `Id`
   This is more in line with gits terminology and feels quite natural to
   use as well.

## 0.2.0 (2021-12-20)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-d0fab1e7f083088f607365ceec056e6e521cbdcc/> new `file::Index::highest_offset()` method
   With it it's simpler to figure out from where to read trailing
   checksums.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-9d9f2ee55202788910cd955cdcc08196d18f2cf5/> Use `[u8;4]` as chunk id
   This allows to remove the additional string to describe the ids, which
   are usually ascii anyway.

## 0.1.0 (2021-12-20)

Initial release with enough functionality to handle multi-pack indices and commitgraph files.
